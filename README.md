This is a fully-featured, real-time multiplayer Tetris implementation that demonstrates advanced Full Stack JavaScript architecture with perfect synchronization between players.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Perfect Multiplayer Synchronization**
- **Server-controlled timing** ensures all players move in perfect lockstep
- **Real-time state synchronization** across all connected clients
- **Identical piece sequences** for all players in the same game
- **Network-resilient design** handling delays and maintaining sync integrity

### 🎮 **Complete Tetris Gameplay**
- All 7 standard tetromino pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- Full movement controls (left, right, rotate, soft drop, hard drop)
- Line clearing with penalty system for multiplayer
- Real-time scoring and spectrum display
- Continuous piece flow with next piece preview

### 🌐 **Advanced Multiplayer Features**
- URL-based room joining (`#room[roomName][playerName]`)
- Room leadership system with game control
- Real-time opponent spectrum visualization
- Penalty line distribution when clearing lines
- Winner determination and game-end handling
- Automatic leadership transfer on disconnect

### 🏗️ **Robust Architecture**
- **Client**: Functional programming with React Hooks (zero `this` keyword)
- **Server**: Object-oriented design with Express + Socket.io
- **Real-time Communication**: Comprehensive Socket.io event system
- **State Management**: Pure functions for all game logic
- **Testing**: 98.23% coverage with 262 passing tests

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd red_tetris_boilerplate

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Edit configuration if needed
# Edit params.js for your needs
```

### Development Mode

#### Start the Server
```bash
npm run srv-dev
```
Launches a Node.js server with Socket.io for real-time multiplayer communication.

#### Start the Client (Development)
```bash
npm run client-dev
```
Launches webpack dev server with hot reload at `http://localhost:8080`

#### Run Both (Recommended)
```bash
npm start
```
Runs both server and client in development mode.

### Production Mode

```bash
# Build client bundle
npm run build:client

# Start production server
npm run prod
```

Server will be available at `http://localhost:3004` (or configured port in `params.js`)


## 🎮 How to Play

### Joining a Game
1. **URL Format**: `http://localhost:8080/#room[RoomName][PlayerName]`
2. **Example**: `http://localhost:8080/#roomTetris2024John`
3. **Auto-join**: The game automatically parses the URL and joins the specified room

### Game Controls
- **←/→ Arrow Keys**: Move piece left/right
- **↑ Arrow Key**: Rotate piece
- **↓ Arrow Key**: Soft drop (faster fall)
- **Spacebar**: Hard drop (instant drop)

### Multiplayer Rules
- All players receive **identical piece sequences**
- When you clear N lines, opponents get N-1 **penalty lines**
- Penalty lines appear at the bottom and cannot be cleared
- **Last player standing wins**
- Room leader (👑) can start the game
